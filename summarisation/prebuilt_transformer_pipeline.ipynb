    "\n",
    "Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years. His party made big gains in Congress. Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate. President Obama's got a mandate. And a majority. What's to stop him?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government. They had just waged a revolution against a king. To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress.\n",

    "The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minority of 41 senators can \"filibuster'' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote. How many votes will Republicans have in the Senate? 41 or 42, depending on the outcome in Minnesota where ballots are still being counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presidents often have problems holding their own party together. That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests.\n",

    "When the people want something, they will get it, whether it's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes.\n",

    "Why doesn't the United States have a metric system or dollar coins like other countries? Because the people won't use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obama's popularity is soaring right now. When a president is popular, he has clout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone wants to be on his side, even members of the opposition party. They're in business for themselves, and supporting a popular president is good for business. Standing in his way could drive them out of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine. It was never designed to be. It has to be lubricated by public pressure.\n",
